``` python

    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>

``` python
# Hello! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today? Feel free to ask me any questions or let
# me know if there's a task I can help you with.
```

``` python
Download an image of a cat, resize the long size to 256 while keeping the apect ratio, and show it
```

    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>

Certainly! I’ll use the `requests` library to download an image of a cat
from a public API, resize it using `PIL` (Python Imaging Library), and
display the result. Here’s the code to accomplish this:

``` python
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Download cat image
url = "https://cataas.com/cat"
response = requests.get(url)
img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

# Resize image
target_size = 256
ratio = target_size / max(img.size)
new_size = tuple(int(dim * ratio) for dim in img.size)
resized_img = img.resize(new_size, Image.LANCZOS)

# Display resized image
resized_img
```
